# STATE: [PROJECT_NAME] Development Tracker

> **Single source of truth for project status, current contracts, and history.**
> Replaces what used to be four separate files (`STATE.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
> `DECISIONS.md`). Updated by `/spec-sync` and `/context-update`.

> **Status legend**
> `⏳ pending` — not started
> `🔄 in-progress` — agent implementation in progress
> `✅ done` — gate checks passed, committed, merged
> `⚠️ NEEDS_REVIEW` — spec changed, phase scope may be stale
> `❌ blocked` — cannot proceed, see Blockers section
>
> **Impl By:** `🤖 agent` · `—` (not yet started)

## Phase Status

| Phase    | Status     | Tag    | Gate | Impl By | Notes |
|----------|------------|--------|------|---------|-------|
| -        | -          | -      | -    | -       | No phases yet — run `/phase-init 01` |

<!-- Add new rows here via /phase-init N -->

---

## Current Contract

> Technical contract as of the latest completed phase. Append-only — never remove an entry unless
> `SPEC.md` explicitly removes it (via `/spec-sync`). Updated by `/spec-sync` (on contract-changing
> spec edits) and `/context-update` (on phase completion).

**Phase completed:** `—` · **Phase in progress:** `—`

## Project Log

> Append-only, newest entry first. One entry format for everything that used to be split across
> `CHANGELOG.md` entries, `DECISIONS.md` ADRs, and the old "Expert Feedback Log" / "Rollback
> Notes" sections. Never delete an entry — if a decision is superseded, add a new entry that says
> so and leave the old one in place.
